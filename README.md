Three projects made for the course "Distributed and Concurrent Programming" (MSc, Computer Science @Unibo)

## 1st Assignment ##
Professor Ricci gave us a program which simulate the behaviour of N bodies inside a field. 
These bodies are moving because of the repulsive force between them.
The program needs to do a lot of computation, so the simulation is slow.
Our goal is to provide a solution to speed-up the simulation using different threads.
For more information you can check the assignment report (only available in italian).


## 2nd Assignment ##
This assignment is divided in three points:
- Realise a task-based version of the first assignment.
- Event-driven Asynchronous Programming.
- Reactive Programming.

## 3rd Assignment ##
