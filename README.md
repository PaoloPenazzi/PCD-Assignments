Three projects made for the course "Distributed and Concurrent Programming" (MSc, Computer Science @Unibo)

## First Assignment ##
Professor Ricci gave us a program which simulate the behaviour of N bodies inside a field. 
These bodies are moving because of the repulsive force between them.
The program needs to do a lot of computation, so the simulation is slow.
Our goal is to provide a solution to speed-up the simulation using different threads.
For more information you can check the assignment report (only available in italian).
